All those learning experiences play a role in enhancing children's cognitive capacities and their self-efficacy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe think that the effects we see are partly a result of the fact that children engaging in school music over many years mostly receive quality music instruction and need to master the high expectations of performing at a high school band or orchestra level. In fact, it is that high levels of music engagement for which we saw the strongest effects.‚Äù\n",

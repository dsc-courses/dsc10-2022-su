Hi everyone! I am Judy, a senior student double majoring in data science and geoscience. I spent most of my life in Beijing, China, before studying at UCSD, and I also love to travel around the world. Besides, this is my last quarter at UCSD and is my third time tutoring DSC10. I am looking forward to seeing all of you, and please feel free to chat with me or ask me any questions!

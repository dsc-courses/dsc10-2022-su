Hello! My name is Teresa and I was raised in Sacramento County. I graduated from UCLA in Fall 2020 with a B.S. in Applied Math and minor in Statistics; I am currently a Statistics Master's student at UCSD. For the last two quarters, I was a TA for the capstone course (DSC 180A&B), and I also have a few years of experience as a Data Science Intern at Intel--I am looking forward to sharing how to apply the skills from DSC 10 to your future careers! In my free time, I enjoy volunteering, exploring the beaches & hiking trails in SD, baking/cooking new recipes, and reading fiction novels.

Hello everyone! My name is Eric and I’m a first year Data Science major from Orange County, California. When I’m not focused on school, I really like watching food-related videos and listening to K-Pop (been listening to a lot of ENHYPEN). Since this is my first time tutoring, I am excited and a little bit nervous. But I can’t wait to meet you all and I hope we will be able to learn from each other!

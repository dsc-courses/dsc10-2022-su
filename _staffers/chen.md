Hello everyone! My name is Eric and I’m a rising second-year Data Science major
from Orange County. When I’m not focused on school, I really like watching
food-related videos and listening to K-Pop (been listening to a lot of
ENHYPEN). This will be my second time tutoring, so I am still kind of new to
it, but I am excited to be a DSC 10 tutor again. I can’t wait to meet you all
and I hope we will be able to learn a lot from each other!

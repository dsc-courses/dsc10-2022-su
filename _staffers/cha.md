Hey everyone, I'm Gabriel! I was born in Maryland, raised in Houston, and now living in California. I'm a First-Year in Sixth College majoring in Data Science. Real excited to meet new faces and talk about the sciences of data. Outside of class, you might see me skateboarding around campus. Feel free to reach out, love to hear from y'all!

Hi all! I am a second-year master's student in the ECE department with a focus
on Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Control. I graduated from UCSD with B.S.
in Electrical Engineering (Machine Learning) in 2020 (Yes, I barely got my
graduation this year). I have been teaching for 4+ years (Tutored in High
School, Undergrad, and now TAing as a Grad student). I really enjoy teaching
and getting to know students. Outside of school, I enjoy rollerskating, hiking,
reading, and writing.

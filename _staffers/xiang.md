Hi, I am Du! I am a senior studying Data Science here at UCSD. This is my 4th time tutoring DSC10, and I believe this will be a really fun class to start in the field of data science. During my free time, I like to play acoustic guitar and listen to some jazz music. Feel free to share your music albums to me as well!

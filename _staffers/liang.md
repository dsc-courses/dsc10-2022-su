Hi everyone ! My name is Wenhua (Wendy) and I’m a student majoring in data science from Shenzhen, China. I like to play sports, hang out with my friends, and play chess and cards outside of classroom. This is my first time tutoring for DSC10, so I’m super excited to share with you the joy within data science.

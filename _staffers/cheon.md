Hello! My name is Harry and I am a Second Year double majoring in Applied Mathematics and Data Science. I was born in Seoul, South Korea but moved to Hong Kong when I was 10, so I call both cities my home. I am an avid sports fan, including Esports, love talking and debating about them! I am excited to tutor DSC 10 this quarter because it is an introductory course where you learn what Data Science is about. While the course may be challenging, I can guarantee that it will be interesting!

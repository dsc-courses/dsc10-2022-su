Hi guys! My name is Tiffany and I am a second-year Data Science student from
Warren College. My hometown is Beijing, China. Besides studying, I love dancing
and playing the piano. I do k-pop dance covers during my spare time. This is my
second time tutoring DSC10 and I am super excited to pass my passion to all of
you. Feel free to chat with me about anything related to data science. Can't
wait to meet y'all on campus!

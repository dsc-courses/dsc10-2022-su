I'm a PhD student at UC San Diego in Cog Sci, where I design new tools for
teaching data science. In my natural habitat, I'm watching "Carnitas are Easy,
Inexpensive, and Delicious | Kenjiâ€™s Cooking Show" at Camellia Road with a taro
milk tea. My top five SD bites are: Yokohama Yakitori Koubou, Tacos El Gordo,
Woomiok, EE NAMI, Wayfarer Bread, Goi Cuon, Regent's Pizzeria oops that's seven.
